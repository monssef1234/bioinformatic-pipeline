In the script, you need to define the paths to the required files and directories, which allows the script to locate and access these resources. The paths you need to specify are:

    FASTQ_DIR: This path should point to the directory containing your FASTQ files. These files are your raw sequencing data, and the script will perform quality control and trimming on these files.

    OUTPUT_DIR: This is the directory where all output files generated by the script will be saved, including FastQC reports, trimmed reads, alignment files, and variant annotations.

    REFERENCE_GENOME: This path should point to the reference genome file (in FASTA format) that the script will use for aligning the reads. The reference genome is crucial for accurate mapping and variant calling. Additionally, you need to prepare the genome for alignment by indexing it with BWA. The index files will be stored in the same folder as the reference genome.

    SNPEFF_PATH: This path should point to the SnpEff JAR file, which is used for variant annotation. The script will use SnpEff to analyze the impact of the variants identified.
