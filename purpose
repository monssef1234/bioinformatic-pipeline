This script is designed to automate the entire workflow of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, from quality control to variant annotation. Specifically tailored for human genome data, it covers key steps including:

    Quality Control: Ensures the quality of raw FASTQ files using FastQC.
    
    Read Trimming: Performs adapter trimming and quality filtering on paired-end reads with TrimGalore.
    
    Alignment: Aligns trimmed reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using BWA.
    
    Post-Processing: Converts SAM files to BAM, sorts, and indexes the aligned reads with samtools.
    
    Variant Calling: Calls genomic variants using bcftools.
    
    BCF to VCF Conversion: Converts BCF files to VCF format for downstream analysis.
    
    Variant Annotation: Annotates the identified variants using SnpEff, providing insights into potential functional impacts.

The script is intended for researchers and bioinformaticians working with human genomic data, providing a comprehensive and automated pipeline for variant discovery and annotation.
